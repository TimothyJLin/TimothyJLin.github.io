# TimothyJLin.github.io
This is a project meant to help people locate competitor's records in tabroom. As of now, this tool only works for Lincoln-Douglas debaters.

It is also important to point at the other tools that one can use to achieve the same result.
1. looking up someone's name followed by tabroom.com
  For example: Googling **Timothy Lin tabroom.com** would quickly help you find my profiles.
2. Using the debate search engine from debate.land
3. Log into speechanddebate.org and search for a name in the "search profiles" section

**How to use this tool:**
1. Input the name of the competitor into the text box labelled "competitor"
2. click Enter and wait for results

There may be multiple results, due to multiple people having the same name or duplicate entries.

**A few limitations of this tool:**
1. It only can find information of people with names or schools whose characters only include alphanumeric characters, dots(**.**), commas(**,**), underscores(**_**), apostrophes(**'**), back slashes(**\**), dahes(**-**), open and close parentheses(**(**) (**)**), or asteriks(*).
If your name or name of your school does not include one of the following characters. it is unlikely you will be able to find your name using this tool.

2. This tool only works for Lincoln Douglas debate-and only for NSDA debaters on Tabroom. This tool will not find debaters from other events or debaters who are not on Tabroom.

3. Because this tool is not constantly scraping, very new entries may be excluded from the search engine.
